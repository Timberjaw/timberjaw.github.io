        <p>I’ve been thinking a bit about versioning. StupidRPG as a project is version controlled, just like any software project should be. Now I’m considering versioning save files, at a yet-to-be-determined level of granularity.</p>
<p>The problem this is intended to solve is program changes breaking a player’s save file. For example, if I remove an area entirely from the game, and the player’s save puts them in that area, now they have an invalid savestate.</p>
<p>Versioning the save file (as a whole) allows for ‘migrations’ (a script that transitions the structure of the data) for save-breaking changes like this. A change that removes an area would also include a version migration to check for objects in the area and move them to another location deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>I don’t <em>think</em> there’s any case where the versioning needs to be more granular (i.e. per-entity versioning). I sure hope not.</p>

        <p>This one’s pretty simple. SRPG breaks if you kill everything, so that won’t be allowed. In a perfect, psychopathic world, you’d have the freedom to murder everyone, but that doesn’t seem particularly feasible in this case. This is similar to games like Skyrim or Fallout 3, where you can kill <em>most</em> people, but certain key NPCs (without whom the game is impossible to complete) are protected.</p>
<p>This might seem like an odd thing to mention, but it’s a design decision that doesn’t simply happen on its own. The default behavior is mirrored from the <code>EAT</code> (can’t eat anything by default) behavior: you can fight anyone by default, with restrictions on fighting certain characters. It will have consequences, however, based on the factions of the targets you choose.</p>

        <p>A filter is a piece of code that runs <em>before</em> an action, to determine whether it should be allowed or modified. The first use of this feature is a filter for taking objects from containers. If the container is closed (something the <code>TAKE</code> verb has no knowledge of), the container filter makes sure execution doesn’t continue (and an appropriate response is generated).</p>
<p>It’s a valuable feature, but a bit rough around the edges.</p>
<h2 id="Filters_Now"><a href="#Filters_Now" class="headerlink" title="Filters Now"></a>Filters Now</h2><ul>
<li>Easy to set up, works fine for simple cases</li>
<li>Behavior for multiple filters is undefined (that’s bad)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Filters_Later"><a href="#Filters_Later" class="headerlink" title="Filters Later"></a>Filters Later</h2><p>I need to expand the feature set to handle more complex situations. Primarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>More advanced feature constraints (e.g. “filter for <code>TAKE</code> from a container in the Cave”). Right now a filter runs for all actions matching the given verb.</li>
<li>Handling of multiple filters in a predictable way. I don’t have a firm solution for this yet. The simplest way to handle it is a prioritized list, but the relative priority of two filters isn’t necessarily the same in all situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a couple use cases I’ve been considering, for which filters <em>might</em> be applicable. For example, setting a rule for an action like “when entering the Cave while holding food” would be a challenge in the current system.</p>

        <p>The SRPG engine doesn’t have much built-in profiling (performance, memory usage, etc), and to be honest I don’t know much about profiling in Javascript. It’s one of the many low-priority items I need to research, so I’m making note of it here.</p>
<p>The engine doesn’t currently prune unused/inactive objects, leading to some concern that it will scale poorly once more of the game is built (e.g. running NPC ticks for characters across the world, consuming memory by keeping locations that can no longer be accessed, etc).</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don’t want to optimize prematurely. It’s possible the total size of the game won’t be big enough to cause problems on a decent computer.</p>

        <p>The Black Box is getting close to complete, so I want to review my goals and make sure what I’ve built (am building) is right. This list is not exhaustive, but it’s a start.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the prelude/prologue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t assume the player knows how to play interactive fiction. Conventions may not be clear, some hand-holding may be required.</li>
<li>The player has one or two utility items (wand, boots, notebook, etc).</li>
<li>The player knows nothing about the story, the world, the tone, or the game mechanics.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the middle:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player is proficient at moving around the world, interacting with objects, and speaking to NPCs.</li>
<li>The player has acquired additional items, such as the Rainbow Sword.</li>
<li>The player has started one or more quests, and may have completed a side quest already.</li>
<li>The tone of the game and the core mechanics are established. A small amount of worldbuilding has been done.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player has completed multiple quests and received rewards for them.</li>
<li>The player has a general idea of what the overall story is about.</li>
<li>The tone of the game is firmly established, but there will still be surprises.</li>
<li>The player has interacted with multiple NPCs, who may be friends or enemies now based on the player’s actions.</li>
<li>The player has had an opportunity to use at least one of their class/race traits.</li>

        <p>I finished reading two books recently, one about the making of Karateka (a game I’ve never played, but by the developer of the original Prince of Persia, which I’ve also never played), and the other about game design in general.</p>
<h2 id="Karateka"><a href="#Karateka" class="headerlink" title="Karateka"></a>Karateka</h2><p>This book was the inspiration for this dev journal, as it’s less of a “how I made a game” book and more of a “here is everything I wrote down as a teenager while making a game” book. A lot of it doesn’t have broader applicability to game development, but certain portions resonated with me. Especially the sections about motivation. It’s easy (sometimes) to know what you should do. It’s often harder to do it, for reasons that are both mystifying and frustrating.</p>
<p>Motivation isn’t quite the right word. There seems to be a difference between being motivated and actually doing something. The latter is an ongoing challenge for me. Sometimes I find myself simply doing nothing, paralyzed not with indecision but with…? I’m working on it.</p>
<h2 id="The_Art_of_Game_Design_3A_A_Book_of_Lenses"><a href="#The_Art_of_Game_Design_3A_A_Book_of_Lenses" class="headerlink" title="The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses"></a>The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses</h2><p>I just finished reading this, and I already feel like I need to re-read it. If a book can make you a better game designer, it’s this one. It doesn’t have all the answers, but it has a glut of food for thought. “A Book of Lenses” is a very apt description/subtitle: it provides many, many different ways of analyzing game design, based on psychology, storytelling conventions, logic, and dozens of other facets.</p>
<p>This dev journal is mostly focused on the creation of StupidRPG (a game), but many of the lenses from <em>The Art of Game Design</em> are applicable to general software development. Understanding your audience, how they will use your product, and what you’re trying to accomplish are incredibly important. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this book to colleagues who have no interest in game development, but are involved in product development in some capacity.</p>
<h2 id="Next_Up"><a href="#Next_Up" class="headerlink" title="Next Up"></a>Next Up</h2><p>I’ve started reading <em>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em>, by Douglas R. Hofstadter. The existence of this sentence makes me feel pretentious somehow. I don’t understand this book yet, beyond the shared concept of ‘loops’ in fields of mathematics, music, logic, etc. The book (a reprint) contains a lengthy forward which addresses (sort of) the intent and meaning of the work. The gist seems to be that most people misinterpret what it’s about. This seems reasonable; a piece of literature that took decades to produce is unlikely to be fully comprehended on first reading.</p>
<p>On the plus side, it has a lot of interesting information about fugues, fractals, and other things starting with F.</p>

        <p>Spoilers inbound. In recent reading, I came across a reference to an interesting rule of twos in scriptwriting: everything in the script should serve two purposes. While this is probably best applied with care, it got me thinking about some of the story/gameplay elements of StupidRPG, and how I could tie things together in a more elegant way.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>In the starting area of the game, Ranger Bob makes reference to <span class="spoiler">a litter problem</span>, which he suspects is the fault of <span class="spoiler">local youths</span>. If the player ever encounters <span class="spoiler">the litterbugs</span> (which is not something I considered guaranteed), it would probably be <span class="spoiler">in town</span> during Act III.</p>
<p>The more I thought about it, however, the more unnecessary it seemed. Rather than introducing a bunch of <span class="spoiler">new NPCs</span> later in the game (when the player may have forgotten about <span class="spoiler">the litterbug quest</span> entirely), why not tie it into something happening in the present?</p>
<p>Enter the <span class="spoiler">Troglodyte, denizen of the forest caves, avid beer drinker, and general layabout. He has a rough life, gets little respect from anyone, and</span> has recently acquired an interest in soaking in the hot springs <span class="spoiler">after a couple drinks.</span></p>
<p>I like this approach because it connects two components of the starting region. Cause, effect, and solution are locally available for the player to experience.</p>
<p>I also have something in mind for the Hot Springs themselves, the presence of which seemed strange to me in a region that otherwise doesn’t seem thermally active. Something to talk about another day.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’m trying to look at my storytelling from new angles. I hope the connections will help create a more cohesive world.</p>
