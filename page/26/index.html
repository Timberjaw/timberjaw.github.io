        <p>Testing is an important component of any software project, and games are no exception. Javascript is easy enough to unit test for core functionality, but the genre of SRPG offers an interesting opportunity for automated game-aware testing.</p>
<p>All input in the game is simply text, and the game engine already has an ‘input queue’ capable of handling multiple commands in sequence. This feature is already being used for one simple test process, to get me back to a particular state in the game after making changes. It can be taken further, however.</p>
<p>Random events in SRPG are handled with a seeded random number generator, meaning that given the same seed and same inputs, all random effects in the game will happen in the same way. That means I can save a transcript (sequence of inputs) and a seed, then play them back and check the output. This is a natural place to automate tests.</p>
<p>My current plan is to develop tests that specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting state (optional, used to shortcut to later portions of the game before testing something specific)</li>
<li>Random seed</li>
<li>Input sequence</li>
<li>Test callback</li>
</ul>
<p>If/when the input sequence concludes, the callback is run to check for certain elements. For example, checking the last text output, or looking at an attribute of a particular object.</p>
<p>Helpful tests could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro process works (race/class selection)</li>
<li>Movement works (starting area)</li>
<li>Checking inventory works</li>
</ul>
<p>During each build, I can run all the tests to get an idea of the health of the game code, and find out immediately if my most recent changes have broken anything.</p>

        <p>One of the open questions I’m contemplating about the design of SRPG is the inclusion (and nature) of a tutorial. I want the game to be reasonably accessible to people unfamiliar with text adventure conventions, but I don’t want an obtrusive starting tutorial. I’m considering a three-part tutorial: implicit, explicit, and help.</p>
<h2 id="Explicit_Tutorial"><a href="#Explicit_Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Explicit Tutorial"></a>Explicit Tutorial</h2><p>In an explicit tutorial, the player knows they are being taught how to play. The tutorial gives instructions and advice, like:</p>
<blockquote>Navigation in StupidRPG is performed using cardinal directions (like on a compass), along with context-specific movement like up and down. To proceed to the next area, type <code>NORTH</code> or <code>N</code>, then press enter.</blockquote>

<p>While helpful, this information is not well-integrated into the game, and is only of interest to complete novices. More experienced players will likely want to skip the tutorial.</p>
<p>If I include an explicit tutorial, it will likely be opt-in (i.e. the player will be prompted to start the tutorial if desired).</p>
<h2 id="Implicit_Tutorial"><a href="#Implicit_Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Implicit Tutorial"></a>Implicit Tutorial</h2><p>An implicit tutorial is more appealing to me, as it’s fully integrated into the game (and story). If done well, the player might not even notice that they’re being guided through the early portions of the game. The first level in Super Mario Bros provides a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH2wGpEZVgE" target="_blank" rel="external">great example</a> of an implicit tutorial.</p>
<p>While I can’t (probably) teach the player something as basic as <em>how</em> to enter a command via implicit means, I can definitely guide them into certain actions that give greater insight into the game mechanics. For example, in the first area of the game, an item on the ground is described to the player. Loot hoarders that they are, most players will attempt to acquire it (via <code>TAKE OBJECT</code>, <code>PICK UP OBJECT</code>, etc). The first area also has only one exit, forcing the player to learn a basic movement command to progress.</p>
<p>I haven’t discussed Command Tags much previously. Command tags take advantage of the game’s HTML output by creating clickable, highlighted links in the game’s text. This is mostly intended as a utility, allowing the player to simply click on objects, people, and scenery to interact with them rather than typing out a command. The default action for command tags is <code>LOOK AT (OBJECT)</code>. When a command tag is clicked, the associated input (which is <strong>always</strong> a text command that they player could have typed themselves) is echoed back and executed. That is, the player sees the command that was executed. If they’re paying attention, they just learned how to use the <code>LOOK</code> command.</p>
<h2 id="Help"><a href="#Help" class="headerlink" title="Help"></a>Help</h2><p>Lastly, I plan on including a help menu (accessible via a link or by typing <code>HELP</code>). The menu will include a general overview of interacting with the game, as well as specific instructions for core commands (<code>MOVE</code>, <code>LOOK</code>, <code>TAKE</code>, <code>INVENTORY</code>, etc). A hint guide might be a nice future addition as well.</p>
<h2 id="Putting_it_All_Together"><a href="#Putting_it_All_Together" class="headerlink" title="Putting it All Together"></a>Putting it All Together</h2><p>There are opportunities for combining these instructional elements. For example, if the very first command the player enters is not understood, they can be prompted to take the tutorial or view the help menu.</p>
<p>Right now I’m focused on the implicit tutorial (which I believe is the most valuable), followed by the help menu (which acts as a nice reference even for experienced players). The explicit tutorial is unlikely to get time devoted to it until later in playtesting.</p>

        <p>Callbacks are functions on an object, typically executed based on an event somewhere in the game. For example, each time a game ‘tick’ occurs, an AI callback is triggered on every living thing (allowing them to move, attack, or take other actions). SRPG has a couple types of callbacks, which I hope to consolidate in future refactoring.</p>
<h2 id="Callback_Types"><a href="#Callback_Types" class="headerlink" title="Callback Types"></a>Callback Types</h2><p>The current callback behavior is slightly convoluted, due to changes mid-development. Initially, each object could only have one callback of a given name, which proved to be too limiting. It meant that I couldn’t stack callbacks to allow objects to inherit behaviors <em>and</em> expand on them.</p>
<p>The quick solution to this was to use an array of functions, and instead of setting the callback directly, add it to the end of the array. This works fine for the most part, but the code feels a bit clunky for more advanced use cases, and due to the mix of new code and old code, I have to perform several additional checks before executing callbacks.</p>
<h2 id="Refactoring"><a href="#Refactoring" class="headerlink" title="Refactoring"></a>Refactoring</h2><p>One of my refactoring tasks is to clean up the callbacks in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Callback prototype which all callbacks inherit from</li>
<li>Standardize all object callback fields to use an array (no direct references to single callbacks)</li>
<li>Standardize callback return values to let the caller know definitively how/whether the callback was handled</li>
</ul>
<p>Reorganizing will allow me to add more advanced callback functionality as well, such as specifying event filters for callbacks, prioritizing callbacks, and allowing callbacks to cancel events entirely (not allowing other callbacks to run).</p>

        <p>One of the many shortcomings of my technology toolkit is C++. I’ve tinkered with it here and there over the years, but the vast majority of my time and energy has gone into easier languages such as C#, Java, and PHP. I set out to rectify that recently by 1) borrowing a copy of <a href="http://amzn.com/0201889544" target="_blank" rel="external">The C++ Programming Language</a> from a generous friend, and 2) diving into a hands-on project well beyond my capabilities. If learning by beating your head against a compiler was a valid way of learning programming, I’d be a Computer Science professor.</p>
<h2 id="The_Project"><a href="#The_Project" class="headerlink" title="The Project"></a>The Project</h2><p>I currently GM two systems: Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition, and <a href="http://www.numenera.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Numenera</a> (a more recent system by former D&amp;D designer Monte Cook). For D&amp;D, Wizards of the Coast had a set of “power cards” produced for every spell in the game. They’re standard playing card size, excellent quality (sturdy and laminated), and big time-savers at the table, especially for newer players or anyone with an inordinate number of spells (hello Wizard!). For most spells it’s no longer necessary to look them up in the rulebook (a few have too much information to fit on a card).</p>
<p>Numenera doesn’t have power cards. Maybe they’ll get around to it at some point (they’ve released card decks for random items and XP). In the meantime, it seemed like a fun project. The basic idea is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the powers (Esoteries for the Nano type/class, Tricks of the Trade for Jacks, and Fighting Moves for Glaives) from the source book(s).</li>
<li>Organize the powers in Excel (separating fields for character type, power tier, title, description, cost and so forth).</li>
<li>Export to CSV.</li>
<li>Import the CSV in my C++ program, loop through the entries and output nicely-formatted card images using ImageMagick.</li>
<li>Print the cards, either on cardstock at home or via a print service / shop.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Step_One_3A_Learn_C++"><a href="#Step_One_3A_Learn_C++" class="headerlink" title="Step One: Learn C++"></a>Step One: Learn C++</h2><p>This process will continue through every other step and beyond. C++ requires more attention to things like memory management, use of references/pointers, and in general has a less friendly syntax than a language like C#. I have several blocks of code that work for reasons still unknown to me, and several things I tried previously failed to work due to equally mysterious causes.</p>
<h2 id="Step_Two_3A_Learn_ImageMagick"><a href="#Step_Two_3A_Learn_ImageMagick" class="headerlink" title="Step Two: Learn ImageMagick"></a>Step Two: Learn ImageMagick</h2><p>I spent way more time on this step than I should have. Most of it can be explained by my inexperience with C++ (and with native Windows development), but it <em>seems</em> like there are a few areas where ImageMagick’s actual behavior doesn’t match its documentation. I eventually got it compiled and working with my program (while learning a lot about lib files and DLL loading along the way).</p>
<p>Once I had the library working, drawing elements to an image and saving it was surprisingly easy. Working with text, however, is another story. Among other issues, ImageMagick doesn’t seem to have built-in support for text wrapping. Since I need to write decent-sized chunks of text and I don’t feel like using a monospaced font, I ended up writing what may be the worst text wrapping function of all time.</p>
<h2 id="Step_Three_3A_Write_the_Worst_Text-Wrapping_Function_of_All_Time"><a href="#Step_Three_3A_Write_the_Worst_Text-Wrapping_Function_of_All_Time" class="headerlink" title="Step Three: Write the Worst Text-Wrapping Function of All Time"></a>Step Three: Write the Worst Text-Wrapping Function of All Time</h2><p>Ok. So there’s no built-in text wrapping. There’s also no built-in way to measure the size of a piece of text. I <em>think</em> there’s a non-ImageMagick way to get the font data that would let me do that, but at this point my head is already full of too much other new information. So I decided to work around the issue using only ImageMagick’s functionality and plain C++. I noticed that when drawing text, you can specify a background color, which will draw a colored rectangle behind the text. You can also sample pixels from anywhere in the image, which turns out to be pretty handy.</p>
<p>Here’s how the text wrap works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the background color AND the text color to red</li>
<li>Write the text onto a temp image</li>
<li>Get a pixel at the right side of the image</li>
<li>If the pixel is red, the text is too long to fit on the line</li>
<li>Cut a word from the end of the text and try again</li>
<li>If it’s stupid but it works, it’s not stupid</li>
</ul>
<p>I did perform some optimizations, as this turned out to be (predictably) slow with longer strings. In particular, I picked a semi-arbitrary character count that I think is unlikely to ever fit on a single line, and I only write/check that amount of text at a time. If I have 800 characters of text to write, chances are no more than about 50 characters will fit on each line (for the font size and image size I’m using). This reduces the number of failed attempts for each line considerably. Each time I write a line, I get the next ~50 characters, move down to the next line and continue.</p>
<p>The function currently lacks a few features (some more important than others):</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t handle overflow off the bottom of the image</li>
<li>Doesn’t minimize wasted space at ends of lines (e.g. sometimes it might be better to leave a larger gap at the end of one line to use the next few more optimally)</li>
<li>Only handles left or right alignment; I’d like to have the text justified</li>
</ul>

        <p>There are many different types of RPGs, and many different types of players. StupidRPG is based on my own experiences and preferences, so there are a few elements I’m prioritizing above the rest in the game.  Here’s a small selection of the most significant items.</p>
<h2 id="Self-Expression_/_Player_Agency"><a href="#Self-Expression_/_Player_Agency" class="headerlink" title="Self-Expression / Player Agency"></a>Self-Expression / Player Agency</h2><p>Most RPGs give the player a lot of options for how they build their character and interact with the world. In essence, the player feels as if the events of the game are being influenced by their actions (i.e. they are not simply triggering the next pre-scripted segment). Pen-and-paper RPGs offer the most freedom in this regard, but computer RPGs can offer a great deal of player agency as well.</p>
<h2 id="Races__26amp_3B_Classes"><a href="#Races__26amp_3B_Classes" class="headerlink" title="Races &amp; Classes"></a>Races &amp; Classes</h2><p>Race and/or class selection are mainstays of traditional RPGs; one of the first steps in customizing your character and dictating your role in the game. Effects are sometimes mechanical, sometimes merely flavor.</p>
<h2 id="Quests"><a href="#Quests" class="headerlink" title="Quests"></a>Quests</h2><p>Quests are ubiquitous in computer RPGs (and common, though often in a more abstract way, in pen-and-paper games). They’re an easy way to give the player direction, track their progress, and offer rewards for specific actions in the world. Plus, what RPG would be complete without an obnoxious fetch quest?</p>
<h2 id="Leveling_Up"><a href="#Leveling_Up" class="headerlink" title="Leveling Up"></a>Leveling Up</h2><p>Becoming more powerful is another nigh-universal trait of RPGs, and StupidRPG is no different. While the game (probably) won’t have XP, it will have a leveling mechanism to expand the player’s capabilities. Whether this means a skill tree, static upgrades, or something else, I’m not yet sure.</p>

<p>Ranger Bob is the watcher and protector of the Forest (the starting region in StupidRPG). He stands vigilant guard from his watchtower, venturing out only to resupply or to deal with emergencies (such as local teens violating curfew at the local hot springs). He doesn’t like to talk much, but for the right adventurer he’ll open up and offer bits of wisdom or general observations about the state of the world relative to the way things used to be.</p>
<p>Bob, son of a baker and a seamstress, hails from the local town of Barony (née Torrensbürg). He has always had a deep affinity for nature, frequently sneaking past the city guards to venture into the deep woods as a child. As an adult, he took over the forest watch after the retirement of the venerable Ranger Karen.</p>

        <p>The most basic element in SRPG is an Entity, which you can think of as a bag of stuff (where ‘stuff’ can mean a name, a list of things, references to other Entities, or functions). Items, locations, and NPCs are all Entities (plus more stuff).</p>
<p>The basic entity definition (or prototype) looks like this:</p>
<p><div class="highlight-header">ECS: Entity Prototype</div><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> Entity = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">this</span>.key = <span class="string">''</span>; <span class="comment">// Identifier</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">this</span>.parent = <span class="literal">null</span>; <span class="comment">// Parent entity</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">this</span>.children = []; <span class="comment">// Child entities</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">this</span>.components = []; <span class="comment">// Component list, for convenience / searching</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">this</span>.onComponentAdd = []; <span class="comment">// Add component callback</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">this</span>.tags = []; <span class="comment">// Tag list; generally the same as the component list</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">this</span>.persist = [<span class="string">'parent'</span>]; <span class="comment">// Raw attributes to persist</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">this</span>.persistActive = <span class="literal">true</span>; <span class="comment">// Save objects by default</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Nothing super exciting here. The base entity mostly defines ‘housekeeping’ items: an identifier, references to parent and child entities, etc. I want to focus on Components right now, as that’s the most important part of ‘everything is an entity.’</p>
<p>Functionality and data associated with game objects are defined by Components. You can think of a Component as a ‘type of thing’. Examples include Place (a location), Region (a group of Places), Living (an entity that is alive), Container (an object that holds other objects), and so forth. Most components correlate to some kind of real-world designation.</p>
<p>The most basic Component is called Thing. When I said ‘everything is an entity,’ I could have instead said that ‘everything is a thing.’ A Thing, of course, is also an Entity, but as a Thing it has a variety of in-world properties.</p>
<p>Things have a bunch of properties included by default, acting as the building blocks of item interaction in the game world:</p>
<ul>
<li>name (e.g. ‘blue flowers’)</li>
<li>descriptions (a list of descriptions for different contexts)</li>
<li>place (the current location of the thing)</li>
<li>spawn (the starting location of the thing)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a bunch of additional elements that make up a thing (mostly callback functions to handle basic behaviors: picking up and dropping the thing, adding more components to the thing, which data to save for the thing, etc). Certain basic items in the game don’t need any additional components, but most will have their interactivity and behaviors further expanded.</p>
<p>For example, the Living component adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>hp (hit points)</li>
<li>onTick (a callback function, run on each game ‘tick’, allowing the object to take actions)</li>
<li>onHit (callback, run any time the object is attacked)</li>
<li>onDeath (callback, run when the object’s HP is reduced to 0)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Example_3A_Containers"><a href="#Example_3A_Containers" class="headerlink" title="Example: Containers"></a>Example: Containers</h2><p>The Container component is a bit more advanced, as it is actually dependent on the Holder component. Components can specify a dependency list (meaning other component(s) the base object should also have). The Holder component specifies functionality used by both the Container (an object in which other objects can be placed) and Supporter (an object <em>on</em> which other objects can be placed) components.</p>
<p>The Holder component specifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>capacity (how many objects can be held)</li>
<li>isTransparent (whether the object can be seen through)</li>
<li>canTakeFrom and canPutInto (whether things can currently be placed in/on the holder)</li>
<li>inventory (a list of objects being held)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Container component adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>isOpen (whether the container is open)</li>
<li>onOpen and onClose (callbacks, run when the container is opened/closed)</li>
<li>onList (callback, overrides a basic Thing callback and controls how the object’s description is printed)</li>
</ul>
<p>The onList callback is particularly notable, as it changes based on the isTransparent property (from Holder) and the isOpen property (from Container). If the container is open <em>or</em> transparent, its contents are listed when the object is described. Otherwise, only the object itself is described.</p>
<p>The Supporter component also has an onList callback, but it’s much simpler as it doesn’t need to pay attention to transparency or openness.</p>
<h2 id="Component_Interactions"><a href="#Component_Interactions" class="headerlink" title="Component Interactions"></a>Component Interactions</h2><p>In general, there are no hard-coded restrictions on which components (or how many) can be applied to a particular entity. This has advantages (e.g. you can do interesting things like allowing a location to be alive and move around the world) and disadvantages (e.g. whatever happens when you add two components, each of which overrides the ‘onList’ behavior). Interactions can become complex or hard to predict. I was aware of this while building the system, and felt that the disadvantages could usually be worked around, while the advantages were particularly exciting to me.</p>
