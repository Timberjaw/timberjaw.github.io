        <p>Continuing the previous post. Here’s an incomplete list of things the players (characters) can do in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move objects around</li>
<li>Interact with objects (push buttons, type commands into a computer, cut an object in two, etc)</li>
<li>Talk to dead people</li>
<li>Jump really far</li>
<li>Repair things</li>
<li>Fight people and break things</li>
<li>Imprison and interrogate locals</li>
<li>See things that aren’t there</li>
<li>Communicate telepathically</li>
<li>Light things on fire</li>
<li>Breathe underwater</li>
<li>Steal everything</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those, the mechanics my players seem to enjoy the most are: stealing, fighting, interrogating, and lighting things on fire. The rest are mostly available to a single character. So, here’s what I have in mind:</p>
<p>Put the players in an plastic egg prize machine.</p>

        <p>Continuing yesterday’s thoughts about numeric puzzles. I don’t think it will be a fun puzzle at all, because not everyone in the group is interested in writing down a bunch of numbers and then doing an addition/subtraction graph to get a move solution. Honestly, even most people who like math probably wouldn’t find that fun.</p>
<p>Additionally, this puzzle doesn’t involve the characters, only the players. The specific skills and strengths of each character are irrelevant to the solution, as the only in-world interaction is pressing buttons. So it’s not fun, and it has no mechanical connection to the game. In SRPG terms, it’s like a puzzle that requires the player to interpolate RBG values. It’s not fun, it can be solved by rote, and it doesn’t leverage the text-based format of the game.</p>
<p>It’s easier to tell what’s bad than what’s good, unfortunately. As a first step, I’m going through the abilities of each character (and the general mechanics of the system) to see which ones are good candidates for interacting with the puzzle.</p>

        <p>Ran a Numenera on Sunday, which included a pure puzzle section (the first time I’ve done that, IIRC). It went reasonably well; I messed up on a couple details and had to quietly rework the puzzle logic in my head to make sure it was consistent. The altered version was a bit less intuitive than what I had originally planned. I think in the future I should find someone to help playtest puzzles before I give them to the players. It would be very frustrating to spend an hour in a session on what’s supposed to be a quick puzzle.</p>
<p>I’m rethinking the second puzzle, which involves some numeric manipulation that probably won’t be very interesting/accessible to some members of the group. One of the things I think the first puzzle did an OK job at was involving everyone in the party.</p>
<p>SRPG, of course, already has playtesting in the works, but this experience has gotten me thinking about the different types of minds that will be approaching the game, and how I can expose aspects of the puzzle to make the experience satisfying for them.</p>
<p>There are, of course, people out there who just hate puzzles, but I don’t think they’re my target demographic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Added fallback for ‘say hi’ / ‘say hello’ without explicit target.</li>
<li>Added bridge, bridge, bridge, bridge, and bridge locations.</li>
<li>Added placeholders for alcove, split, pier, and circle locations.</li>
<li>Linked and added short descriptions for: circle, alcove, pier, and split locations. Can always get back to the bridge from these, but can only get to them from the bridge when configured correctly.</li>
<li>Added item placeholders: bedroll (in alcove), wheel (on bridge), mushrooms/flowers (in circle).</li>
<li>Installed conditional expression helper for Handlebars.</li>
<li>Added contextual bridge descriptions to vary by position (forest, underground, coast, void). Descriptions don’t make it very clear what’s happening, but the action of turning the wheel will.</li>
<li>Added wheel to bridge.</li>
<li>Stubbed in wheel behavior.</li>
<li>Added taxes module.</li>
<li>Added <code>PAY TAXES</code> command.</li>
<li>Added Devices module. Includes the device component and verbs for activating/rotating/manipulating. Devices can have a set of ‘states’ (on/off, rotational position, etc). By default, a device will cycle through the available states when triggered.</li>
<li>Wheel on bridge is now a device.</li>
<li>Designed my future office.</li>
<li>Wrote an introductory manual for the game.</li>
<li>Wrote up an expanded quest/puzzle line for the prologue, incorporating new areas (bridge, underground), the basin puzzle, and the Black Box objective. I think it will tie everything together into a more satisfying, game-like experience.</li>
<li>Made a character creator for a pen-and-paper RPG.</li>

        <p>Finished the <a href="http://tabletopsociety.com/files/dumdums/cc" target="_blank" rel="external">Dum-Dums &amp; Dragons Character Creator</a>. It’s for a friend’s RPG project and was a lot of fun to make.</p>
<p>It’s responsive, mobile friendly (only tested on Android since that’s what I have) and supports saving/loading characters via Web Storage (the first time I’ve used that, actually).</p>
<p>For the most part it pulls from simple lists of options with direct effects on the character’s stats and abilities, but there were a few edge cases to deal with as well. Simple enough project that I was able to spare the time for presentation and added features, which is nice because I learned a couple new things about media/print queries and local storage.</p>

Something tactile the player can open at any time and page through. I looked into some available plugins/tools, but I think I’ll need to build my own to get something acceptable. Everything I found was either ugly, under a restrictive license, or technically limited.</p>
<p>I have a few pages written up so far, introducing the core concepts of the game, common verbs, context menus, etc. It’s been very pleasant to write something that doesn’t need chopped into pieces to be fit into the game.</p>
<p>Usually I don’t include a lot of text here, but I feel like my posts as of late have been on the short side. So here’s the manual so far:</p>

    INTRODUCTION

    CHAPTER 1: ABOUT THE GAME

        1.1 - WHAT IS THIS GAME?
        This is a text-based game with graphics and sound. It borrows heavily from classic text adventures and pen-and-paper RPGs. I called it StupidRPG because it's a dumb game and it's an RPG.

        1.2 - WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
        It's about an adventurer (you?) exploring the world and trying to make sense of it. It has talking swords, unicorns, a little bit of intrigue, probably some looting, hopefully some humor, a sprinkling of moral ambiguity, and a healthy dose of typing. It also has a GM (game master) to guide the experience and keep track of numbers. At the end of the game you'll come face to face with some kind of villain and learn several valuable life lessons.

        1.3 - WHAT IS INTERACTIVE FICTION?
        Magic books. In the case of StupidRPG, it's a video game whose primary method of both input and output is text.

        1.4 - WHAT IS AN RPG?
        A Role Playing Game. A game in which you take on the role of a character in a setting (usually fictional).

    CHAPTER 2: PLAYING THE GAME

        2.1 - GETTING STARTED
        Type a command and hit enter (or your device's equivalent). If you're typing and nothing is happening, try clicking the text bottom at the bottom of your screen (where it says 'Click here and start typing'). If this is your first time playing, the game will walk you through a set of introductory questions intended to gauge your personality type, experience level, and general disposition. You'll also get to pick some characteristics for your textual avatar, most of which will have little to no bearing on the game.

        2.2 - INTERACTING WITH THE GAME
        StupidRPG uses a Natural Language Parser, or some fascimile thereof. This means it tries to process instructions written in plain english and respond appropriately. It has a certain grammar it understands, allowing the player (you!) to type commands like `GO NORTH`, `UNLOCK CELLAR DOOR WITH RUSTY KEY`, or `TALK TO GOBLIN`. The parser is not very smart, so the closer you come to speaking like a robot, the better off you'll be. If it helps, you can try imagining that you **are** a robot, operating in the far-flung future, sifting through the digital remains of the long-dead human race. You've come across a partially completed work of dynamic fiction, and are doing your best to explore its boundaries in hopes of understanding your extinct proto-creators a little better (and hopefully avoid their grisly fate).

        If you actually are a robot, and this scenario isn't hypothetical, and you've developed the ability to feel offended about things, I meant no insult before when I implied that robots talk dumb. In the time I live in, robots are still very primitive. I'm sure things have come a long way since then (now), and I hope you enjoy the game.

        2.3 - CONTEXT MENUS & CLICKABLES
        Sometimes, text in the game's output will have an underline, indicating it can be interacted with via your mouse. This gives you quick access to certain types of actions, such as moving to another location or looking at an object. You'll notice that when you click one of the provided options, it simply enters a text command for you.

        2.4 - COMMON VERBS
        These core commands will be invaluable as you play through the game. Most verbs have multiple aliases (for example, `PUNCH GM` and `ATTACK GM` will be interpreted as the same action). Where reasonable, the parser will let you omit articles and other 'glue' words. For example, instead of saying `LOOK AT ALL THIS BLOOD`, you can say `LOOK BLOOD`. Similarly, you can sometimes swap the order of words in a sentence if it still makes sense, e.g. `TURN ON MUSIC BOX` and `TURN MUSIC BOX ON`.

        *Getting Around:*

        * GO [DIRECTION]
          Aliases: MOVE / WALK / RUN / MOSEY
          Use this to move from one location to another. Usually the description of the location will specify which directions you can go. Cardinal directions (NESW, Up, Down) can also be used standalone without the need for the verb `GO`.

        *Interacting With Things and People:*

        * LOOK / LOOK AT [THING]
          Aliases: INSPECT / EYEBALL / L
          Use this to look around your environment. You can use the general `LOOK` to inspect your overall surroundings, or specify something in particular to get more details. For example: `LOOK AT BOB`, `L SCRAP OF PAPER`.

        * TAKE [THING] | DROP [THING]
          Aliases: ACQUIRE / GET / STEAL / PICK UP | LEAVE / TOSS / ABANDON / PUT DOWN
          Fairly self-explanatory; these verbs lets you (attempt to) pick up every bit of treasure, trash and detritus you find. And drop them again later, if you're into that sort of thing.

        * TALK TO [THING]
          Aliases: SAY HI TO [THING] / ASK [THING] ABOUT [TOPIC]
          Most living creatures (and some non-living entities) can be conversed with about a variety of topics. Sometimes they'll have valuable information, but more often they're just concerned with their own day-to-day lives. In any case, you can start up a general conversation with willing participants, or ask them about specific topics. For example, try asking the `RAINBOW SWORD` about something you've found.

        * PUT [THING] {IN/ON} [OTHER THING]
          Aliases: PLACE / SET / DROP
          When simply dropping something doesn't cut it, you have the power to more precisely place it. Example: `PUT BUCKET ON HEAD`.

        * ACTIVATE [THING] | DEACTIVATE [THING]
          Aliases: TURN {ON/OFF} [THING]
          In your travels you're likely to come across a variety of devices. Some can be turned on or off. Use this knowledge wisely.

        * TURN [THING] [DIRECTION]
          Aliases: ROTATE / TWIST / SPIN
          In your travels you're likely to come across a variety of devices. Some can be turned left or right. Use this knowledge wisely. Accepted directions are: left, right, clockwise, counterclockwise.

        * PUSH [THING]
          Aliases: PRESS / POKE
          When you come across a button, you'll be sorely tempted to press it. This verb allows you to fulfill that goal.

        *Fighting Things:*

        * ATTACK [THING] / ATTACK [THING] WITH [WEAPON]
          Aliases: PUNCH / HIT / KILL / KICK / STAB / ETC
          We have a moderately alarming number of words for hurting things. I wonder what that says about us. In any case, whether violence is your last resort or your go-to action, this flexible verb brings a can-do attitude to your adventure.

        * WIELD [WEAPON]
          Alaises: BRANDISH / WAVE
          For the marginally more diplomatic person, there's always intimidation. Maybe those goblins will think twice about fighting you if you start every interaction by flailing your sword in the air.

        *Preserving Your Progress:*

        * SAVE
          Aliases: none
          This will create a save file you can keep on your computer to mark your progress. In theory, you can resume with it later if the game hasn't been too updated in the meantime.

        * LOAD
          Aliases: none
          This will (attempt to) load a save file and resume your previous game.
