        <p>StupidRPG is very, very modular. Most of the core functionality of the engine and the main campaign are implemented in modules. Examples of modules include: combat (fighting things), social (talking to things), containers (things that open and close), darkness (whether things are visible based on available light), etc. There are a few reasons for this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>The engine is (mostly) reusable for a completely different type of text adventure</li>
<li>The game/engine is relatively straightforward to mod</li>
<li>I thought it would be a fun challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>Long-term, I’d like to expand SRPG to include some level of multiplayer. This has been a driving factor in the architecture of the ECS (Entity-Component-System) library. The ‘player’ is not particularly special in the architecture, by design. NPCs possess a similar ability to influence the game world/state, and Player 2 has little technical distinction from an NPC. By extension, within the context of the engine, the player is just another entity imposing its will on the game state. This is useful.</p>
<p>SRPG has no protection against source modification. The game runs entirely in Javascript in the player’s browser. As such, it is very hackable, moddable, and breakable. This applies to both the singleplayer and multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>I’m ok with this.</p>
<p>I spent a bit of time with <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank" rel="external">Cookie Clicker</a>. Hacker/cheater that I am, I eventually discovered the built-in variables and functions for unlocking content, maximizing stats, and generally breaking the game. This is Not A Problem in Cookie Clicker because the game is single player only. If you ‘ruin’ the experience, you’re only ruining it for yourself. I have the same mentality about SRPG, as I see only two valid use cases: playing alone, or playing with friends. In either case, if you want to mess with the engine or content, go nuts.</p>
