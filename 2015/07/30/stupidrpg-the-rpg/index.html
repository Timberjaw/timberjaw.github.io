        <p>There are many different types of RPGs, and many different types of players. StupidRPG is based on my own experiences and preferences, so there are a few elements I’m prioritizing above the rest in the game.  Here’s a small selection of the most significant items.</p>
<h2 id="Self-Expression_/_Player_Agency"><a href="#Self-Expression_/_Player_Agency" class="headerlink" title="Self-Expression / Player Agency"></a>Self-Expression / Player Agency</h2><p>Most RPGs give the player a lot of options for how they build their character and interact with the world. In essence, the player feels as if the events of the game are being influenced by their actions (i.e. they are not simply triggering the next pre-scripted segment). Pen-and-paper RPGs offer the most freedom in this regard, but computer RPGs can offer a great deal of player agency as well.</p>
<h2 id="Races__26amp_3B_Classes"><a href="#Races__26amp_3B_Classes" class="headerlink" title="Races &amp; Classes"></a>Races &amp; Classes</h2><p>Race and/or class selection are mainstays of traditional RPGs; one of the first steps in customizing your character and dictating your role in the game. Effects are sometimes mechanical, sometimes merely flavor.</p>
<h2 id="Quests"><a href="#Quests" class="headerlink" title="Quests"></a>Quests</h2><p>Quests are ubiquitous in computer RPGs (and common, though often in a more abstract way, in pen-and-paper games). They’re an easy way to give the player direction, track their progress, and offer rewards for specific actions in the world. Plus, what RPG would be complete without an obnoxious fetch quest?</p>
<h2 id="Leveling_Up"><a href="#Leveling_Up" class="headerlink" title="Leveling Up"></a>Leveling Up</h2><p>Becoming more powerful is another nigh-universal trait of RPGs, and StupidRPG is no different. While the game (probably) won’t have XP, it will have a leveling mechanism to expand the player’s capabilities. Whether this means a skill tree, static upgrades, or something else, I’m not yet sure.</p>
