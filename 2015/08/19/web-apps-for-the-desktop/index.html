        <p>This is a weird one. SRPG is a website (web app?). But what if…what if you could run web apps directly on your desktop?</p>
<p>Well, as it turns out, technology has come full circle. A few months back I looked into a system called TideSDK, which acted as a native wrapper around WebKit (the backend for browsers like Chrome) and allowed you to distribute websites/web-apps as native applications. On the face of it, this is slightly ridiculous, and I don’t have much of an argument for why such a thing should exist (beyond “lots of people have experience building software with web tools these days”).</p>
<p>TideSDK died under mysterious circumstances, but the semi-recent release of the Atom.io IDE (built on NodeJS) led to the creation of <a href="http://electron.atom.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Electron</a>, which performs similar functions but has the advantages of being 1) not dead, and 2) open source. It took about 3 minutes to install it and get StupidRPG running:</p>

<p>So far so good. Supports full screen, seems to be using a recent (if not the latest) version of Chromium (which means that dumb rainbow text works, unlike in TideSDK), and gives access to the standard debug tools. Nifty.</p>
<p>On to the tougher bit: finding a good reason to view this as anything other than a novelty. It does open up a few interesting features / conveniences. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helpers for native file handling (handy for save files/etc, but you can accomplish this without much trouble in a standard website)</li>
<li>Can add user tasks (basically a context menu on your application icon). Don’t have an immediate use for this.</li>
<li>Can easily register global keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Can create native menus and native context menus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Super exciting, I know. Not a compelling case yet, but it’s been fun to play with. Now that I think of it, Steam doesn’t have nearly enough text adventures…</p>
